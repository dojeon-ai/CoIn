# Adapting Pretrained ViTs with Convolution Injector for Visuo-Motor Control
This repository is an official PyTorch implementation of the paper, *Adapting Pretrained ViTs with Convolution Injector for Visuo-Motor Control*, ICML 2024.

We are sorry for the delay in our code update :(
We plan to make the code public before ICML so stay tuned!
