# Adapting Pretrained ViTs with Convolution Injector for Visuo-Motor Control
This repository is an official PyTorch implementation of the paper, *Adapting Pretrained ViTs with Convolution Injector for Visuo-Motor Control*, ICML 2024.

We are sorry for the delay in our code update :(
Although we do plan to publish our code before September, if there is anyone who requires the code for our work immediately, we will send you my private version of the code. Please reach out at godnpeter@kaist.ac.kr.
